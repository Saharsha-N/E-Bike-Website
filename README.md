# E-Bike-Website
Code for E-Bike Website

This website for the Technology Student Association Competition, for the Lionville Chapter. 
The whole goal of this website is to advertise the fictitious business of selling e-bikes.
The website's goal is to advertise the business of the website, and not the actual e-bikes
themselves. I hope you enjoy it!
